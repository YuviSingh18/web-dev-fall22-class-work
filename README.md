### Senior at SUNY New Paltz majoring in Computer Science

I was first exposed to programming in eighth grade when I took an introductory course in computer science. The course used JAVA as the primary programming language. I learned JAVA till the end of tenth grade and knew the basics of JAVA. I found it to be very interesting, fun and sometimes relaxing. I find debugging the code to be a puzzle which is quite satisfying to solve. This is what wanted to further my study in Computer Science and pursue a career in this field. During my third year of learning JAVA, I build a complete scientific calculator as my final project. During my sophmore year at SUNY New Paltz, I wrote am Inventory Management System using C. And last year I took Software Engineering course in which I worked on a group project as the group leader and built a fully functioning Point of Sale software called FarmManager, which allowed a farm to manage its inventory, sell and rent farm products and equipment respectively. We used php as server side language and html, css and javascript as front end. I worked on 100% of the back end and helped out in the front end as needed. Other than that, this past summer I interned at Fannie Mae(FNMA) as a Software Engineer where I got a chance to work on two different teams in the same department. The first team I worked on was the product team that managed the product owned by the whole department, and the second team was the analytics team for the same product which analyzed the data coming in and out of the product. As a part of the product team, I work on analyzing and documenting new feature for the product and also helped with the PI plannig while working in Fannie Mae's Agile environment. This helped me understand the product inside and out. As part of the analytics team, I helped analyze and organize some data, and also wrote sql queries to pull data from the database which was then used by the dev team to display on the analytics platform. I also helped with implementing a completely new feature from scratch which gave me a chance to learn and work with angular and typescript. Overall, It was a very positive and learning experience.

I see myself using the skills and concepts learned in this course next semester in the projects class and throughout my career in the future no matter where I end up working and what language or framework I use. One thing I have learned from my experience in computer science so far is that the concepts used in all programming languages and frameworks are the same, the only difference is the syntax and keywords which take some getting used to, but you don't need to remember those just need to know where you can find correct documentation.
